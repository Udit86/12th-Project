MNREGA A SUCCESS PR FAILURE A WAY AHEAD 
MNREGA or Mahatma Gandhi rural employment act is a job guarantee scheme, enacted by legislation on 25 Aug`05 & finally launched in Feb `06 under the name NREGA that is national rural Employment guarantee act. The term Mahatma Gandhi was added to it on 2 Oct `09. Presently, it is enacted in almost every district of the country. Taking a little about its key features-
* The scheme provides a legal guarantee for one hundred days of employment in every financial year to any rural adult to do public work related to unskilled labour. 
* Employment should be given within 15 days of application for work, if it is not the person is entitled to get an unemployment allowance. 
* At least one third of the beneficiaries shall be woman.
* Central government to pay for labour and 3/4 of the cost of material and rest including unemployment allowance to be born by state government.
* No contractor or machinery is allowed.
The MENRAGA fulfills twin objectives of rural development and employment constructive works like land leveling, roads construction, afforestation, digging of tanks/ponds,etc are done under MNREGA.
Despite all this, the scheme has faced a lot of criticism. As no major road or infrastructure has been built. Corruption is at its height. Workers often complaint of not being paid full wags or being compelled to give bribe to get jobs even a multi crore fraud has been suspected. The quality of work done under the schemes of poor quality. Due to ban on use of machinery, the labours do not learn any new technique. It is also causing labor shortage especially for farm works. Above all this, it is causing a lot of GDP and destroying labour marckets.the scheme seems to head more towards failure but can be turned to a success by minimal changes in the rules and checking corruption.
