INFILTRATION AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
Infiltration and Illegal immigration are serious problems faced by many states in India. To the extent that demography of several states along our border has changed dramatically,thenby causing resentment among local  population,with respect to avaliabilty of jobs,price rise and rise in crime.partition of India into:India,East Pakistan and West Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh by the partition of Pakistan has been the most prominent cause of infiltration.
Partition of India`can not be remedy to the problem because it will further weaken the borders as well as create new weak areas for easy infiltration. redrawing borders considering ground realites of divided families/then asset could have been a remedy but considering  the ground realitiy ofthe borders where ceasefire violations on common it will remain in politicaldiscussions and would be very difficult to do it.the only remedy with us to solve the problem is strenthen border survilleance and prevent infiltration or illegal immigration.
the border should be properly democrated and the security forces should be provided with good technology and facelities to perform the job.
