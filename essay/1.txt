Relevance of Socialism
India is neither a socialist nor a complete capitalist country. Giving elaboration to the above statement one need to get familiar with the terms socialist and capitalist. A country where everything is reviewed or ruled by the government i.e government has direct control over everything is called a socialist country whereas a country where private ownership is there for all aspect i.e transportation , service etc is referred as a capitalist country.this might a base to the given topic. In my opinion this topic not completely relevant it lack some aspect. It is relevant in the fields where people need their welfare. But its not correct in many sectors , such as defence or technology because the advancement of private companies . A great example of a country supporting this is India . Where there is 49% FDI in the defence sector and in many more aspects there is private investment . But on other side we have China following complete socialism but still on the ground of development it is far ahead from India. We may say that socialism is beneficial for some countries. But in countries likeIndia where in each  and every passed scheme based on money , there is a “shaort scam of thousands of corres of rupees “. In countries like India socialism can’t be reffered because having 7th position in world corruption index doesn’t look good . Also there is a simple belief Lesser the socialism Lesser the corruption lesser the difficulties More will be the development.Socialism i.e government ownership is preferable in some context because it provides various schemes to the people in low cost items to the people through cantens aslso giving pension companies to the people which private companies do not offer.
Conclusively socialism is not so good nor so bad but can be beneficial if the evil practices could be stopped then it will be well enough for a country to develop.
