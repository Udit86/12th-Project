Ban on smoking
It takes only 5-6 rupees to buy a cigarette and go one more step nearer to death.
Cigarettes stick which directly or indirectly can harm human internal organs. They mainly effects lungs and make them incapable of proper breathing. It can also lead to cancer and ultimately to death.
Despite of all these things why do people smoke? According to a survey conducted by a private firm 63% of well educated people smoke as they feel it is a sign of masculinity. Talking about the rest they can’t avoid it. In pragmatic world people are aware of consequences but they ignore them. Many people are chain smokers. Teenager are most vulnerable to habit of smoking as it is an age when they want to try everything.
Govt. has effectively responded to the issue of smoking. Certain rules and regulation are laid out to minimize the use to smoking materials. If a person smokes in a public place he can be imprisoned for couple of months and is fined. Govt. has also raised taxes on such items to regulate the price and keep them out of reach for poor section of society. But to their rescue they have their own methods and ways to prepare their sticks. It is mandatory for the film producer to show a 30 sec slide or movie which condemns smoking in beginning  as well as at the end. It is also necessary to blur the smoking scenes and display subtitle which says “Smoking is injurious to health.” Govt. on their part is trying their level best on minimizing the smoking. Certain rules put a ban on smoking. In my view central govt. must pass a bill which prohibits any person from smoking and it must be implemented with full vigour.
Govt. is trying hard to ban smoking but it can’t be achieved until each and every citizen commits to root it out of the nation.
