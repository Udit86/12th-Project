Economic Development
India has been road to planned economic development since 1st April, 1951. Many important changes were brought about through the second, third and fourth five year plans. Indian economy was given national characters. Capitalism gradually changed its shape. Many privately owned business concerns have been nationalized e.g. Life Insurance, Air transport ,Coal mines, Banks etc.
The first two five year plans took us much ahead on the road to progress. We gained much valuable experiences. Many difficulties were faced and overcome. All sorts of industries were developed. The production of steel was increased several times. Much was also done to tackle the unemployment problems. Industries need power. Many difficulties were faced and overcome.

Many of our river-valley projects were completed, and more power generated.
The Chinese attack in October, 1962 put a severe strain on our economy.
Thought the country has achieved much through the process of planning, much more stills remains to be done. With the help of five year plans India would become self-sufficient in a number of fields, the per capita income would increase still further, and unemployment would be drastically reduced. In short, it would make India more confident, self reliant and prosperous.
